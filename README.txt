Project Intro/Objective
We are conducting a study that involves an approach to identify video games that are likely 
to receive high MetaCritic Review Scores. Our method involves leveraging a predictive model, 
which could help optimize marketing resources and significantly enhance the success rate of 
a company's video game titles. The study aims to identify key features that can predict a 
game's success and help game designers produce more successful games in the marketplace.
